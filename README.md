In this repository I have a developed ETL data pipeline using GCP services like GCS, Big Query, Cloud composer(Airflow) and on premise Apache spark to demonstrate the use of hybrid cloud. the repository is python based.
  GCS is used to store and manage the transactional data \n
  Composer, a managed Apache Airflow service, is utilized to orchestrate Dataflow jobs \n
  BigQuery serves as a serverless data warehouse \n
